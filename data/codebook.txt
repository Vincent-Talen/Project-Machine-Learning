Column Name|Full Name|Type|Feature Description
id|ID|dbl|Identification number for patient/sample
diagnosis|Diagnosis|fct|The class label of the breast mass with "B" = "Benign" and "M = "malignant"
radius_mean|Mean Radius|dbl|Mean of the radius'; A radius is the mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
texture_mean|Mean Texture|dbl|Mean of the textures; Texture is the standard deviation of gray-scale values
perimeter_mean|Mean Perimeter|dbl|Mean of the perimeters; The perimeter is calculated as the total distance between all the points of the snake-generated boundary
area_mean|Mean Area|dbl|Mean of the areas; The nuclear area is the sum of pixels on the interior, with half of the pixels of the perimeter
smoothness_mean|Mean Smoothness|dbl|Mean of the smoothnesses; Smoothness is the local variation in radius lengths
compactness_mean|Mean Compactness|dbl|Mean of the compactnesses; Compactness is calculated with: `perimeter^2 / area - 1.0`
concavity_mean|Mean Concavity|dbl|Mean of the concavities; Concavity is the severity of concave portions of the contour
concave_pts_mean|Mean Concave Points|dbl|Mean of the concave points; The concave points are the number of concave portions of the contour
symmetry_mean|Mean Symmetry|dbl|Mean of the symmetries; Symmetry is calculated as the difference in length of perpendicular lines to the longest chord through the center, in both directions
fractal_dim_mean|Mean Fractal Dimension|dbl|Mean of the fractal dimensions; Fractal dimension is approximated using Mandelbrot's `"coastline approximation" - 1`
radius_se|Radius SE|dbl|Standard error of the radius'; A radius is the mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
