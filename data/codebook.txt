Column Name|Full Name|Type|Description
id|ID|dbl|Identification number for patient/sample
diagnosis|Diagnosis|fct|The class label of the breast mass with "B" = "Benign" and "M = "malignant"
radius_mean|Mean Radius|dbl|The mean of the radius'; A radius is the mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
texture_mean|Mean Texture|dbl|The mean of the textures; Texture is the standard deviation of gray-scale values
perimeter_mean|Mean Perimeter|dbl|The mean of the perimeters; 
area_mean|Mean Area|dbl|The mean of the areas; 
smoothness_mean|Mean Smoothness|dbl|The mean of the smoothnesses; Smoothness is the local variation in radius lengths
compactness_mean|Mean Compactness|dbl|The mean of the compactnesses; Compactness is calculated with: `perimeter^2 / area - 1.0`
concavity_mean|Mean Concavity|dbl|The mean of the concavities; Concavity is the severity of concave portions of the contour
concave_pts_mean|Mean Concave Points|dbl|The mean of the concave points; The concave points are the number of concave portions of the contour
